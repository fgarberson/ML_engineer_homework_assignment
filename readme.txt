YOUR TASK:
----------

Take a look at the code in this codebase. In what ways can it be improved? 
Consider the following aspects specifically:
  - Readability
  - Reusability
  - Modularity
  - Scalability
  - Runtime performance 
  - Conformance to standards and best practices
  
You task is to edit this code to enforce as much of the previous improvement as possible. Don't worry if you don't understand enough about the code to suggest specific improvements. Do you best and make reasonable assumptions and educated guesses. 

When not sure, you can still suggest non-specific edits. For example, if you don't know what a function is doing but still think it needs a descriptive comment, insert one that says: "descriptive comment here to explain x,y,z"

Note that we are more interested in the quality than the quantity of the improvements that you make.


INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

Go ahead and create a branch off master, naming it yourfirstname_yourlastname
You may do multiple commits to your branch, incrementally refactoring the code as needed
When finished, push your commits to github, following best practicies as you would in a production setting
Please do not merge your edits back to master
